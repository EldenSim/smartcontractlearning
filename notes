# Smart contracts:

Code that automatically executes all or parts of an agreement

Stored on a blockchain based platform

Either:

Sole manifestation of the agreement between parties

or

complement a traditional text contract and execute provisions

Immutable, secure and permanent as across the nodes of the blockchain

Before a smart contract (SCs) can be executed a transaction fee has to be paid

For Ethereum, SCs are executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) payment is made through ether, called “gas”

More complex the SC the more gas to be paid to execute

This is to limit too complex SC from overloading the EVM at current time

SC can eliminate the procure-to-pay/Purchase-to-pay gaps

## Procure-to-pay/Purchase-to-pay (P2P)

Procure meaning:

To get possession of or obtain something by particular care and effort

Steps:

1. Requisitioning
    1. Formally requesting a service or item
        1. Done by submitting purchase requisition form or doc
    2. Provides a more controlled and documented method for managing internal supply inventories and future demands.
2. Procurement
    1. Act of obtaining goods or services
    2. Solicit services or purchase goods from vendors 
3. Payment

P2P Automates the whole process when companies requires certain goods or services for their functioning

SC can make P2P processes faster and cheaper as middle men are removed.

## Types of SC:

### Code only SCs:

- The contract is directly reduced into executable code

### Ancillary SCs:

- SC as vehicles to effectuate certain provisions of a traditional text-based contract,
